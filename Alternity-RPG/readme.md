# Alternity RPG Sheet

This sheet is designed for use with the Alternity core player book. Autocalculation of skill scores is available and the roll macros provide the ordinary, good and amazing success score with control die only.  Situation die should be rolled separately.  The sheet also supports custom skills, complete with auto-calc and macro rolls.  It is intended to be used by any user level, and hopefully fits close enough to the original sheets to be familiar to those of the system.

### Changelog
