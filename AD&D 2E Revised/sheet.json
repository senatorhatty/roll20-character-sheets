The sheet no longer requires +'s in front of numbers except where they already exist. -'s are still needed where applicable. Numerous Skills and Powers sections have been added. As well as Psionics, both versions. If in need of assistance or to report a bug, please send a message to https://app.roll20.net/users/877778/seth-f and I will be happy to assist you."
