    "instructions": "You may note the absence of hard and extreme values.  These have been moved into the roll button itself.  When you use the roll button you will see, in the chat log, a roll \"vs standard value/hard value/extreme value.\"  Compare the appropriate threshold to your result to determine success.  For weapon skill select one of the listed skills to base your weapon skill check on.  You may select up to the tenth custom skill as the base skill.  For weapon damages you may specify a \"+0\", \"+1/2db\" or \"+db.\"  Use this to include your damage bonus in the damage roll or not.\n\nYou can find an API script which goes with this sheet at https://github.com/Roll20/roll20-character-sheets/blob/master/Call_of_Cthulhu_7th_Ed/extended_autocalc.js.  This will enable autocalculation of Damage Bonus and Build.\n\nIn support of Pulp Cthulhu a checkbox in the Hit Points section allows for the Pulp Cthulhu rules variant of doubling hit points."
